# Week 08: Random

## Homework

Read the [chapter of random on The Book of Shaders](http://thebookofshaders.com/10/) and watch [Ryoji Ikeda work](http://www.ryojiikeda.com/). Then:

* Make rows of moving cells (in opposite directions) with random values. Only display the cells with brighter values. Make the velocity of the rows fluctuate over time.

* Similarly make several rows but each one with a different speed and direction. Hook the position of the mouse to the threshold of which cells to show.

* Create other interesting effects.

* Grab one of your patterns for the midterm and add random to it.

* Try to make a matrix-like screensaver.
